Project Requirements
Our website has the following features:

Separates all database/business logic using the MVC pattern.
Routes all URLs and leverages a templating language using the Fat-Free framework.
Has a clearly defined database layer using PDO and prepared statements. You should have at least two related tables.
Data can be viewed and added.
Has a history of commits from both team members to a Git repository. Commits are clearly commented.
Uses OOP, and defines multiple classes, including at least one inheritance relationship.
Contains full Docblocks for all PHP files and follows PEAR standards.
Has full validation on the client side through JavaScript and server side through PHP.
All code is clean, clear, and well-commented. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) is practiced.
Your submission shows adequate effort for a final project in a full-stack web development course.


1. We made sure to separate all databases and logic using MVC pattern
2. We created a couple routes that allows us to grab information from the user and that shortens
the url and doesn't allow the users to see the actual file, but they see the template. 
3. Added two related data tables that are linked to one another. 
4. Data can be successfully added to the database and viewed on the summary page.
5. We made sure that we both have a history of commits and that we use clearly commented commits that
make sense.
6. We have two classes that use inheritance relationship. We have a car class and a SUV class and the
SUV class extends and inherits everything from the car class because an SUV has all the same 
characteristics as a car, but more options can be added to the SUV which makes it an inheritance class.
7. We made sure that all the code is not redundant and there are comments above all functions and 
talk about what they do and how they work. 
8. We have full validation both server side and java script
9. All code is well commented 
10. We made sure to put our full efforts and give it the best we can to come up with this website.
